### Endangered_Animals-Article
 
 For this assignment I wanted to do a scientific topic with the article and focused on the firing that have happened within the U.S. government. I wanted to highlight a topic that I have not seen in the news about the firing within the Department of Interior, which is the effect on endangered species. 

 I did not know that it was a data-driven assignment until after I picked the topic and I then became creative with how I was going to get data because I wanted to do this topic. I scraped two websites, one for the endangered animals all around the world (for my knowledge) and one for the latest delisting of endangered animals in the U.S. The last piece of data was in 2023, but it was also recently archived because of the new administration, so I thought it was relevant. 

 I liked the product of this assignment more than my past ones. I think that I had more room to be creative and found a way to be more data-driven.  I wanted to do illustrations, but realized that it was not the topic nor did it have enough captivation as the photos, which was a change I made towards the end.
